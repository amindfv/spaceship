You'll need a recent version of Erlang and the Haskell Platform.

To run the example, first install the dependencies with

   cabal install --only-dependencies

Then run

   runghc Language/Spaceship/Transcompiler.hs examples/HanoiTower.hs

That'll generate examples/hanoi_tower.erl. You can test the generated code with

   cd examples; erlc hanoi_tower{,_tests}.erl && escript hanoi_tower_tests.beam
